% [h] = fscatter3(X,Y,Z,C,cmap);
% Plots point cloud data in cmap color classes and 3 Dimensions,
% much faster and very little memory usage compared to scatter3 !
% X,Y,Z,C are vectors of the same length
% X,Y,Z,C might be put in as structure points.x,points.y,points.z,points.int  
% with C being used as index into colormap (can be any values though)
% cmap is optional colourmap to be used
% h are handles to the line objects
